NordicTrials2024 readme

The dataset “Nordic clinical trials missing results 20240205” provides a list of 475 clinical trials run by non-commercial research institutions based in the five Nordic countries that have never made their results public (neither on a trial registry nor in an academic journal). They are grouped by institution.

Institutions can use this dataset to identify their unreported trials, follow up with the researchers involved, and ensure that the results are made public. 

The methodology used to compile this dataset is described in this preprint published on MedRxiv on 05 February 2024:

Gustav Nilsonne et al. 2024. “Results reporting for clinical trials led by medical universities and university hospitals in the Nordic countries was often missing or delayed”
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.04.24301363v1

On the 06 February 2024, the advocacy group TranspariMED published a report summarizing the data on its website.
